# :rocket: Demo-Autmation :rocket:
This repository contains a Python implementation of an automation process to create Google Slides and Google Meet meetings for demos.

## ü§ñ Introduction

The demo is a process that typically occurs once a month. During this meeting, team members and product owners showcase what they've been working on during the previous period. Despite its simplicity, this process can sometimes take up a significant amount of time on the agenda, which is why we have decided to automate it.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `create_meeting.py`: contains functions to create a Google Meet meeting.
- `lambda_function.py`: the main script that runs the automation process.
- `library.py`: contains helper functions for the automation process.
- `Template` : A folder containg all the _.template_ files required for the Google Slides creation.
- `requirements.txt`: a file contating all the neccessary packages to upload to Lambda.
- `README.me`: this file.

## üìù Requirements

The packages required to run the automation process can be found in _requirements.txt _

You also need to have a Google Cloud Platform account and enable the Google Slides and Google Calendar APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to use

To use the automation process, you need to set up the following:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Slides and Google Calendar APIs.
3. Create a service account with access to the Google Slides and Google Calendar APIs, and download the JSON credentials file.
4. Run those commands for the _requirement.txt_ `pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/` and `zip -r -9 dependencies.zip python`
5. Add _dependencies.zip_ as a lambda layer
6. Deploy the Lambda function to your AWS account.
7. Add an _API Gateway_ as a trigger to your Lambda.
8. Set up a Slash Command to trigger the Lambda function when wanted.

After setting up, you can run the automation process with the command: #0B49D6 /demo DD.MM HH:SS
For Example : 
#0B49D6 /demo 24.4 17:35 : Plan the demo for 24th April At 17:35 OR #0B49D6 /demo 6.4 9 : Plan the demo for 6th April at 9 am

* The MM field is mandatory. The default value is 00
* The start time of the meeting is HH:SS
* The end time of the meeting is start time + 1h30/demo 24.4 11:30 if you want to plan the demo for the 24th of April at 11:30 am 

## üìù Notes

- This project assumes that the target audience for the demo is internal employees, so access to the Google Meet event is restricted to users within the same G Suite domain.
- The `create_meeting.py` script uses the `google-auth` and `google-api-python-client` libraries, so make sure to install them before running the script.
